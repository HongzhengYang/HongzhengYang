### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently interested in machine learning, with a focus on robustness, non-convex optimization and high-dimensional statistics. Previously, I worked on applying deep learning methods into the healthcare domain (medical and surgical images).  

- I obtained my bachelor degree from Beihang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I worked as a postgraduate research assistant at CUHK from 2022/08 to 2024/05.

- I am always open for possible discussions and collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me (hzyang05@gmail.com)
